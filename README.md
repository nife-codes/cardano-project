# MediSure
### Decentralized Pharmaceutical Verification on Cardano

**🔗 [Live Demo](https://medisure-ebon.vercel.app/)** | [Backend API](https://medisure-backend-t5yr.onrender.com/api/)

## Project Summary

MediSure is a blockchain-based supply chain tracking application built on Cardano. It allows pharmaceutical manufacturers to mint digital twins (NFTs) of drug batches, distributors to track them, and patients to instantly verify authenticity using a transparent, immutable ledger.

---

## The Problem

Fake drugs kill thousands of people in Nigeria annually.

**Trust Gap:** Patients cannot verify if the medicine in their hand is real.

**Centralized Failure:** Scratch-card systems rely on central databases that can be hacked or manipulated by corrupt insiders.

**Visibility:** Manufacturers lose sight of their products once they leave the factory.

---

## The Solution

We built a decentralized Track-and-Trace system:

**Minting:** Manufacturers verify their identity and mint "Batch Tokens" (NFTs) representing physical drugs.

**Tracking:** These tokens are transferred through the supply chain wallets (Factory → Distributor).

**Verification:** Patients scan a QR code (Asset ID) to query the blockchain directly, receiving a "Verified" or "Fake" status without needing a middleman.

---

## Why Blockchain / Cardano?

**Immutability:** Once a drug batch is minted on Cardano, its data (expiry, composition) cannot be changed by anyone, preventing data tampering.

**Native Assets:** Cardano handles tokens natively without complex smart contracts, reducing costs and security risks.

**Low Fees:** The transaction fees on Cardano are low enough to make tracking everyday medicine economically viable in Nigeria.

## How to Test the MVP

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nife-codes/cardano-project.git
cd cardano-project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend folder:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Start server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

**Base URL:** `https://medisure-backend-t5yr.onrender.com/api/`

### Core Endpoints

**POST `/api/mint/`** - Mint a new batch (called by blockchain after NFT creation)

**POST `/api/transfer/`** - Transfer batch between entities

**GET `/api/verify/{qr_code}/`** - Verify medicine authenticity (for patients)

**GET `/api/journey/{batch_id}/`** - Track batch through supply chain

### CRUD Endpoints

- `/api/manufacturers/` - Manage manufacturers
- `/api/distributors/` - Manage distributors
- `/api/pharmacies/` - Manage pharmacies
- `/api/batches/` - Manage batches
- `/api/transactions/` - View transactions

## Smart Contract Workflow

### 1. The Core Logic: Native Scripts (Minting Policy)

MediSure does not rely on a centralized database. Instead, it uses **Cardano Native Scripts** to define the rules of existence for every batch of medicine.

**The Policy:** We utilize a ForgeScript with a "One Signature" constraint.

**How it works:** When the Manufacturer connects their wallet, the application derives a unique Policy ID based on their wallet's signature. This ensures that only the specific Manufacturer's wallet can ever mint tokens under this Policy ID.

**Security:** If a counterfeiter tries to create a fake token, it will have a different Policy ID, and the MediSure verification system will immediately reject it.

### 2. The Asset: Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Generation

When the "Mint" command is executed, the application builds a Cardano transaction that performs two atomic actions:

**Minting:** It generates exactly 1 unit of a unique asset (The Batch Token). This scarcity (Quantity = 1) makes it a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), representing a specific physical box or pallet of medicine.

**Naming:** The Asset Name is converted to Hexadecimal (e.g., Batch-2025-001) to comply with ledger standards.

### 3. The Data: On-Chain Metadata (CIP-25 Standard)

To create a "Digital Twin" of the medicine, we attach metadata directly to the minting transaction using the **CIP-25** (Cardano Improvement Proposal 25) standard.

This data is not stored on a cloud server; it is etched into the blockchain transaction itself:

- **Batch ID:** Unique identifier
- **Expiry Date:** Critical safety data
- **Manufacturer:** The verified identity
- **Chemical Composition:** Drug details

Because this data is on-chain, it is **immutable** (cannot be changed) and **permanent** (cannot be deleted).

### 4. The Verification: Zero-Knowledge Trust

The Patient Verification Portal acts as a "Block Explorer" tailored for healthcare.

**Query:** The app searches the Cardano Preprod network for the specific Policy ID or Asset ID.

**Validation:** It cross-references the token found on-chain against the known Policy ID of the legitimate manufacturer.

**Result:**
- ✅ **Match:** The Green Checkmark proves the drug originated from the Manufacturer's wallet
- ❌ **No Match:** The system flags the product as counterfeit
